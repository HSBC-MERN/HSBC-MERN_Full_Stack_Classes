##  What is a Database in MongoDB?

A **database** is a container that stores multiple collections.  
It is created automatically when you begin inserting data.

#### Definition:
A database in MongoDB is a logical grouping of collections used to organize data.

#### Create or Switch to a Database

```javascript
use schoolDB;
```

If `schoolDB` does not exist, MongoDB creates it when inserting the first document.

#### Check existing databases

```javascript
show dbs;
```

---

## What is a Collection?

A **collection** is a group of documents inside a database.

### #Definition:
A collection is similar to a table in SQL but does not require a fixed schema.

#### Create a Collection

```javascript
db.createCollection("student_details");
```

View all collections:

```javascript
show collections;
```

---

##  What is a Document?

A **document** is a JSON-like object stored within a collection.

#### Example Document:

```json
{
  "name": "Ravi",
  "email": "ravi@gmail.com",
  "skills": ["Java", "Python"],
  "address": { "city": "Vijayawada", "state": "AP" }
}
```

## MongoDB Data Types

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| String | "Ramu" |
| Number | 25 |
| Null | null |
| Array | ["Java", "Node"] |
| Object | {city: "Hyd"} |
| Boolean | true |
| Function | ()=>{} |
| ISOTime | ISODate() |
| Date | new Date() |

## CRUD Operations in MongoDB

CRUD = Create, Read, Update, Delete

---

## CREATE – Insert Data

### insertOne()

**Definition:** Inserts a single document into the collection.

```javascript

    phone: "974561238"
});
```

---

### insertMany()

    {name: "rani", email: "rani@gmail.com"},
    {name: "admin", email: "admin@gmail.com"}
]);
```

---

## READ – Find Data

### findOne()

**Definition:** Returns the first matching document.

```javascript
db.student_details.findOne();
```

#### Filter:
```javascript
db.student_details.findOne({ name: "Ravi" });
```

#### Projection (field selection):

**Definition:**  
Projection is used to include (1) or exclude (0) specific fields.

```javascript
db.student_details.findOne(
    { name: "Ravi" },
    { _id: 0, name: 1 }
);
```

---

### find()

**Definition:** Returns all matching documents.

```javascript
db.student_details.find();
```

```

Multiple conditions:

```javascript
db.student_details.find({ name: "Ravi", fee: 90000 });
```

Projection:

```javascript
db.student_details.find({}, { _id: 0, name: 1 });
```

---

## DELETE – Remove Data

### deleteOne()

**Definition:** Deletes the first document matching the filter.

```javascript
db.student_details.deleteOne({ name: "Ravi" });
```

---

### deleteMany()

```

---

## UPDATE – Modify Data

- `$set` → Modify or add fields  
- `$unset` → Remove fields  
- `$push` → Add value to an array  
- `$pop` → Remove element from array  
- `$inc` → Increase or decrease numeric value  

---

### updateOne()

**Definition:** Updates the first document matching the filter.

#### Example using $set:

```javascript
db.student_details.updateOne(
    { name: "ramu" },
    { $set: { phone: "9874561230", collegename: "KEC", branch: "CSE" } }
);
```

#### Example using $unset:

```javascript
db.student_details.updateOne(
    { name: "Ramu Kumar" },
    { $unset: { phone: "" } }
);
```

---

### updateMany()

**Definition:** Updates all documents matching the filter.

Increase fee:

```javascript
db.student_details.updateMany(
    { fee: 90000 },
    { $inc: { fee: 30000 } }
);
```

Decrease fee:

```javascript
db.student_details.updateMany(
    { fee: 90000 },
    { $inc: { fee: -20000 } }
);
```

Push skills into array:

```javascript
db.student_details.updateMany(
    { name: "Ramu Kumar" },
    { $push: { skills: ["java", "python", "ruby"] } }
);
```

---

#### $pop Example

**Definition:** Removes first (-1) or last (1) element from an array.

Remove last skill:

```javascript
db.student_details.updateOne(
    { name: "Ramu Kumar" },
    { $pop: { skills: 1 } }
);
```

Remove first skill:

```javascript
db.student_details.updateOne(
    { name: "Ramu Kumar" },
